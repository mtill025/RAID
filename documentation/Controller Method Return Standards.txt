Standards for what should be returned by RAID controller methods:

For methods that are retrieving entire asset information:
    Always return RaidAsset object - generate RaidAsset object from RaidResponse if error

For methods that are updating asset information in system:
    Always return RaidAsset object, generated from request response if request is made,
     - or generated from RaidResponse if failure is detected before request is made

For methods that are retrieving one property of an asset:
    Return property if successful, otherwise return None
